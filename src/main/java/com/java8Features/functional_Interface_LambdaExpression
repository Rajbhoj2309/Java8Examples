Why do we need Lambda Expression
Reduced Lines of Code One of the clear benefit of using lambda expression
 is that the amount of code is reduced.
we can create instance of a functional interface using lambda expression rather than using anonymous class.

Sequential and Parallel Execution Support Another benefit of using lambda expression
 is that we can benefit from the Stream API sequential and parallel operations 
 support.
