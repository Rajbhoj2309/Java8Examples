 1. forEach() method in Iterable interface
Whenever we need to traverse through a Collection, we need to create an Iterator whose 
whole purpose is to iterate over, and then we have business logic in a loop for each of 
the elements in the Collection. We might get ConcurrentModificationException if the iterator 
is not used properly.

Java 8 has introduced forEach method in java.lang.Iterable interface 
so that while writing code we focus on business logic. 
The forEach method takes java.util.function.Consumer object as an argument, 
so it helps in having our business logic at a separate location that we can reuse. 
Let’s see forEach usage with a simple example.
